        <h3>ShowcaseView by Espian(dev)</h3>

<p>ShowcaseView is a library which helps give your app that extra flair. It is designed to easily insert reliable, Holo-designed guides into your app, to point out features that users might not notice, such as gestures.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Version 2 of the API (available now) was designed to be super simple to use, and now requires a single call (one of the <code>insertShowcaseView(...)</code> methods) to place a ShowcaseView into your app hierarchy. Whilst there are additional options, the single method above - which comes in many different flavours - will produce a quick yet professional output.</p>

<p>Version 2 also added support for showcasing some action bar items. This currently doesn't work for split ActionBars, but that should hopefully be coming soon.</p>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>The library is compatible with all the way down to Android 2.1, which is API level 7.</p>

<h3>Maven</h3>

<p>There have been multiple requests for hosting this project on Maven. I don't have much experience with Maven, but plan to have a go at hosting it there too - I will report back once finished.</p>
