It is designed to easily insert reliable, Holo-designed guides into your app, to point out features that users might not notice, such as gestures.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nVersion 2 of the API (available now) was designed to be super simple to use, and now requires a single call (one of the `insertShowcaseView(...)` methods) to place a ShowcaseView into your app hierarchy. Whilst there are additional options, the single method above - which comes in many different flavours - will produce a quick yet professional output.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 also added support for showcasing some action bar items. This currently doesn't work for split ActionBars, but that should hopefully be coming soon.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\nThe library is compatible with all the way down to Android 2.1, which is API level 7.\r\n\r\n### Maven\r\nThere have been multiple requests for hosting this project on Maven. I don't have much experience with Maven, but plan to have a go at hosting it there too - I will report back once finished.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n[My Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/110510888639261520925/) is the easiest way to contact me directly.
